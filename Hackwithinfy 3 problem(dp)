Your are given an Array Arr of size N. You are asked to split the array into multiple subsets of length at least 3 such that each element belongs to exactly one subset. The cost of splitting the array is the sum of costs of each subset, where the cost of a subset is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subset. Find the minimum total possible cost of splitting.

Constraints:

1<=N<=2*10^5

1<=Arr[i]<=10^9
